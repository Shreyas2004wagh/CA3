# CA3 - Meal Suggestion App

## Introduction
Vijay is on a mission to solve the daily struggle of deciding what to cook. He envisions an application that suggests random dishes to make the decision-making process easier for individuals who cook for themselves regularly. Your task is to assist Vijay in bringing this idea to life by implementing the application.

## API Integration
To kickstart the development, I have successfully fetched data from [The Meal DB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) using two key endpoints:
1. **Random Meal API:** Retrieve a random meal suggestion from [https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php](https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php).
2. **Category-based Search API:** Fetch details for searching food by category, specifically focusing on the "Seafood" category, from [https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?c=Seafood](https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?c=Seafood).

## Problem Statement
People who cook daily often face the dilemma of deciding what to cook. Vijay aims to address this challenge by creating an application that suggests random dishes, eliminating the need for users to spend time contemplating their daily meals. Your role is crucial in turning this vision into a reality.
